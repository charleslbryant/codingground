#ProjectEuler.net

These are some of my alogrithms used to solve ProjectEuler.net problems.

I just noticed that ProjectEuler.net recommend you don't save solutions outside of ProjectEuler, but this is the best way for me to save and compare coded solutions. So, if you haven't solved these yet, don't cheat :) My algorithms are most likely not the best solution, so it would be worth your time to just code your own solution.
